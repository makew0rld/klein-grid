# klein-grid

[kleingrid.makeworld.space](https://kleingrid.makeworld.space)

This is a clean microsite for filling out the [Klein Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_Sexual_Orientation_Grid)
questionnaire. It was made because the top result for "klein grid" is the bi.org questionnaire which
is poorly designed.

Notably, I vibecoded basically all of this with Claude Code using Opus 4.5. The commit history will
show who contributed what.

I wrote:
- PLAN.md
- README.md
- Prompts that produced each commit (not captured)
- Some copy, again see the commit log

All the website files were written nearly entirely by Claude.

## License

I've added an MIT license but it's probably public domain because it's AI. Huh.
